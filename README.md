Backend: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, OpenFeign, MySQL

Frontend: React.js, Axios, React Router, Bootstrap

Security: JWT Authentication

Development Tools: Postman, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, SonarQube

System Architecture
The system is built using a microservices architecture, with the following services:

Admin Service: Handles menu management (Add, Update, Delete dishes)

User Service: Handles order placement and tracking

Kitchen Service: Manages order status updates

Authentication Service: Manages user roles and security

All services communicate via REST APIs using OpenFeign.

Admin can add, update, and delete dishes

Order Placement:

Users can place orders by providing table ID and order details

Order Tracking:

Users can check order status (Pending → Preparing → Served)

Kitchen Order Management:

Kitchen staff updates order status

Authentication & Security:

Login/Register system with JWT authentication

Bootstrap UI Enhancements:

Modern, responsive interface

Role-Based Access & Pages
Admin Pages:

Manage Menu (Add, Update, Delete Dishes)

User Pages:

View Menu

Place Order (Table ID + Order Details)

Track Order Status

Kitchen Pages:
